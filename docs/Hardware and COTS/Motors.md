# Motors

Our team uses the [CTRE Phoenix 6 API](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/index.html) for programming, which is compatible with motors and controllers sold by [CTRE](https://store.ctr-electronics.com) and [West Coast Products](https://wcproducts.com). We primarily use [Kraken X60 and Kraken X44](https://docs.wcproducts.com/welcome/frc-build-system/electronics-and-pneumatics/brushless-motors) brushless motors, which have an integrated TalonFX controller.

## Kraken X60

The Kraken X60 is the largest brushless motor sold by West Coast Products. It has an integrated TalonFX controller.

**Primary Applications:**

- Swerve module drive motor
- Swerve Module steering motor
- High inertia linear motion, e.g. elevator
- High inertia rotational motion, e.g. arm pivot
- Shooter motors

## Kraken X44

The Kraken X44 is a smaller version of the X60. 

**Primary Applications:**

- Swerve module steering motor
- driving wheels or rollers for intakes, indexing, etc.
- Low inertia or low speed motion

## CTR Minion

The CTR Minion is the smallest and lightest motor we use. It does not have an integrated encoder, and the outer housing of the motor spins with the shaft, making it vulnerable to impacts from game pieces or other parts of the robot. 

**Primary Applications:**

- Same as Kraken X44
- Only use the minion when extremely space or weight constrained, or we are out of x44 motors

## 775 Pro

The 775 Pro is a brushed motor which uses an external Talon SRX controller. We have a lot of them, and they are compatible with the versa planetary gearbox.

**Primary Applications:**

- Prototyping
