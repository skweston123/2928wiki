# Fasteners

## Screws

- We use primarily 10-32 screws for structural applications
- We sometimes use 8-32 screws for mounting non-structural items, like electronics
- 1/4-20 screws can be used if there are very high loads on a single screw
- We sometimes use smaller screws, 4-40 and 6-32, for mounting very small electrical components

## Rivets

- 3/16 high strength aluminum rivets can be used for structural applications like drivetrain and superstructure
- 3/16 and 5/32 aluminum rivets can be used for creating light and rigid subassemblies
- Rivets should NEVER be used for assemblies that will need to be disassembled for access or maintenance
